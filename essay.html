                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                            <p>User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) in the context of web design are the 
                            two most important fundamental principles used to make websites interactive for the 
                            user. It is a way of ensuring users engage with your website effortlessly and 
                            effectively. It is a principle that guides web designers on how to make user-centered 
                            websites and web pages. But what are UI and UX? What constitutes good UI and 
                            UX? These are the questions I seek to answer in this essay, and I will use 
                            Property24 as the basis for my argument and analysis as it relates to UI and UX, 
                            interaction, and ethics.
                            </p>
                        <h1>What is UI & UX?</h1>
                        <p>What is User Interface? According to Jair Leite, "User Interface (UI) is a message 
                            that communicates to users what they can do with an application and how they can 
                            use it." (Leite, 2002). He describes UI using the interaction model, which can be 
                            broken into 3 parts:
                        </p>
                        <p>"The Function Command specifies the way users enter information and control the execution of 
                            application function. Interaction results are user to provide feedback to users about function 
                            results or error messages. The Browsing Control is an optional component that is used to allow 
                            users to control another user interface objects. Pop-up and pull-down menus and the window 
                            minimization and maximization controls are examples of browsing control." (Leite, 2002).
                        </p>
                        <p>User interfaces are all of the functional components the user interacts with. This 
                            includes, but is not limited to, all hardware and software used to direct the user’s 
                            actions. First, we have "interface signs are the widgets, icons, words, menus, dialog 
                            boxes, wizards (assistants), and all interface elements that can convey messages. 
                            Interface signs convey designer’s message to users and are also a medium to the 
                            interaction activity." (Leite, 2002). Second, "the display medium is the physical 
                            medium where all interface signs are conveyed. The interaction activity happens 
                            through it. The display medium is usually the computer screen." (Leite, 2002). And 
                            lastly, "the activation tool refers to any mechanism that can be used to perform 
                            actions using the interface signs in the display medium. Users’ arms and fingers, 
                            mouse device, light pens are examples of the activation tool." (Leite, 2002). User
                            3
                            engagement is at the core of good UI design, everything needs to be clearly labelled
                            and specified to ensure users are engaging with the website as intended.
                            What is User Experience? UX refers to the fundamental components of a website 
                            that provide knowledge about a product or service. UX is the structural building block 
                            on which UI is built. For example, UX makes the website useful, and UI makes it 
                            presentable. "UX design focuses on the interaction that a human user has with 
                            everyday products and services. The goal of UX design is to make using these 
                            products and services, both digital or physical, easy, logical, and fun." (Oppliger, 
                            2021). And it "involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating 
                            the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function." 
                            (Interaction Design Foundation, 2023). UX is built with a product or service in mind. 
                            It’s there to boost consumer interest, as it is the core of the website. Functionality is 
                            at the heart of UX design, "where the main objective is to create effective websites 
                            where the user quickly and efficiently can obtain the desired pieces of information 
                            without being delayed by long downloading times or blind alleys when navigating on 
                            the site" (Thorlacius, 2007:64). UI is used to complement UX. Think of UX as the 
                            foundation on which UI is built upon.

                            <h1>Property24</h1>
                            <p>Property24 is a South African online property auction company that provides 
                                services across the country for homebuyers and real estate agents. They are the 
                                leading property website in South Africa, providing top real estate companies with 
                                brand exposure and marketing. With an estimated 6 million visitors a month, their 
                                website connects real estate companies with homebuyers and renters searching for 
                                property online.
                            </p>

                            <p class="caption">Figure 1.1. Property24</p>
                            <p>I have chosen Property24 because I think they have kept this simple for the sake of 
                                functionality. And by functionality, I mean "the user-friendly aspects of interfaces and 
                                Human Computer Interaction (HCI), where the main objective is to create effective 
                                websites where the user quickly and efficiently can obtain the desired pieces of 
                                information without being delayed by long downloading times or blind alleys when 
                                navigating on the site." (Thorlacius, 2007:64). This is all brought about by good UX 
                                design. The site uses the basic UX design principles, which are:
                            </p>
                            <p>Von Restorff Effect: make important information visually distinctive. We see this 
                                being done with the Filters and More Filters Button, Search Panel, and Order By. 
                                This is done to help the user remember the key actions and guide them to where you
                                want them to go.
                            </p>
                            <p>According to Hick's Law, time spent making decisions increases with complexity. 
                                They used this with the filter’s dropdown menu and search bar. This is done to help 
                                users navigate through the website and save them time from scrolling through a 
                                hundred listings when they need something specific.
                            </p>
                            <p>Serial Position Effect: key information must be placed at the beginning and end and 
                                less important in the middle. At the top, they’ve placed the search panel, the name of 
                                the website, filters, and order by. At the bottom are their contact and bio information, 
                                along with their social media accounts. In the middle, they have house listings, etc. 
                                5
                                This is how information is structured in order for users to fully engage with your 
                                website.
                            </p>
                            <p>Call to action (CTA): this involves all the symbols used to call upon the user to 
                                perform a certain action. It is a visual communication tool needed to ensure users 
                                know how to engage with your website because "visual symbols have become an 
                                integral part of our daily lives. Therefore, it is increasingly relevant to understand 
                                their communicative effects. The orientation towards visual communication is not 
                                only prevalent in marketing but in all forms of professional communication, including 
                                the Web site as a medium." (Thorlacius, 2007:66). As a website that serves many 
                                people, it becomes important to have these symbols in place in order to save time 
                                and keep the visitors cognitive load light. The search, bed, and car symbols are all 
                                semiotic devices that communicate a message to the reader, thus increasing user 
                                interaction.
                            </p>
                            <p>The UI design for this website is also very good. First color and font "If we choose a 
                                vibrant, warm red colour for the menu, we communicate something different than if 
                                we had chosen a calm, cool blue colour. If we have a specially designed typography 
                                made for our headlines we leave a more personal impression on our Website than if 
                                we choose the most common typography such as, for example, Verdana." 
                                (Thorlacius, 2007:63). With the Property24 logo being blue, we see that’s what 
                                influenced the color choice for the header, price, and font. The background is white, 
                                so the user's attention is centered on the housing and nothing else. The principles of 
                                UI are evident here. All information has been centered, everything is clearly labeled,
                                and cognitive load is reduced as users perform the same action over and over again. 
                                Overall, in my opinion, Property24 has done an excellent job with their website. It is 
                                user-centered and simple, and thus it is a good example of good UI and UX design.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                            <p>In conclusion, the principles of good UI and UX are integral components needed to 
                                make websites interactive. It is without a doubt that user interaction is influenced by 
                                how a website is structured and presented, so giving high consideration to how you 
                                want your users to engage with your website is the first step all web designers need 
                                to take because this will influence how users experience your site and thus affect the 
                                product or service you are selling. Property24 has done this to good effect and has 
                                6
                                kept things simple and easy to understand. It is the job of web designers to aim for 
                                this when making a website, keeping the user at the center of their design.

                    <h1>Abstract</h1>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the fastest growing technology in development across the world. As part of the digital revolution AI seeks to transform how people live, work, and communicate. We’ve witnesses in brief some of the capabilities it has with ChatGPT, deepfake and voice cloning. However, technologies that can improve happiness, health, and productivity for billions of people are also posing challenges for individuals and governments. Recent incidents have highlighted the impact of algorithmic culture and AI on privacy, national security, and democracy. This essay examines the impact of these technologies on the internet in response to the CAIS statement. </p>
                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>What is AI? Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines that can perform tasks independently without human assistance. It is a branch of computer science that simulates human intelligence, enabling machines to think and act like humans. AI is already employed in a number of sectors, including banking, transportation, and the medical field, and it is predicted that in the future it will completely change how we live and work. AI's unique ability to learn, reason, plan, and solve logical problems like humans makes it a valuable tool for businesses and organizations. However, there are concerns about its ethical implications, particularly in terms of privacy and job displacement. Despite these concerns, AI's potential benefits make it an exciting area for research and development. AI can analyze large amounts of data and make predictions based on patterns, making it particularly useful in marketing and customer service. As AI technology advances, it has the potential to improve efficiency and productivity in various industries. However, it is essential to prioritize openness and responsibility while developing AI and to do so within a firm ethical framework.</p>
                    <p>The arrival of AI has sparked a great debate on ethics, safety, and employment. Many working professionals fear that AI can and will be used to commit crimes, undermine the integrity of learning institutions, and spread misinformation. However, "The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined." (Frankenfield, 2023). But as algorithms and AI become more sophisticated, concerns arise about potential bias and discrimination. Policymakers struggle to keep up with the ethical and legal implications of these developments. Open discussions on technology's role in society and a framework balancing innovation and accountability are essential.</p>
                    <h1>‘Statement on AI Risk’</h1>
                    <p>The Center for Artificial Intelligence Safety (CAIS) is an American research and field-building nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. They work to develop safety research in AI by reducing the societal-scale risks associated with AI. They believe that AI will benefit humanity greatly and improve the overall living standards of everyone, but AI must first pass its safety test in order to be used in everyday life. The basis of their work is to conduct research on AI, teach about the dangers of AI, and advocate for safety standards. As part of their initiative, CAIS released a statement on their website on May 30, 2023. Stating the following: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." (CAIS, 2023). The argument is brought on because Artificial intelligence is a philosophical field concerned with the mental and ethical implications of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence based on the idea that human intelligence can be well characterized. However, "we’re at an especially dangerous time for AI because the systems are at a place where they appear to be impressive but are still shockingly inaccurate and have inherent vulnerabilities." (Paul, 2023). This subject has been studied in mythology, literature, and philosophy since ancient times. According to computer scientists and philosophers, AI could threaten human survival if its thinking capacity is not directed toward constructive goals. Economists warn of the risks of AI-related layoffs and job losses if social policies are inadequate. This concern is reflected when you look at who the signatories are. Everyday working professionals like computer scientists, AI scientists, CEOs, politicians, professors, engineers, biologists, etc. from all over the world. This is concerning when you understand the world we live in. We live in a capitalistic society where profit is king, and we’re already seeing companies go semi-automatic, where humans and machines work in collaboration. The fear is that companies will soon go fully automated with the help of AI</p>
                    <p>What is AI risk? According to CAIS, "AI systems are rapidly becoming more capable. AI models can generate text, images, and videos that are difficult to distinguish from human-created content. While AI has many beneficial applications, it can also be used to perpetuate bias, power autonomous weapons, promote misinformation, and conduct cyberattacks." (CAIS, 2023). AI risk is the intentional or unintentional use of AI to cause harm and danger to groups of people, companies, governments, and nations. Because AI is taught to simulate human intelligence, we need to first identify whose intelligence it is replicating. Is it western? Is it upper or lower class? Is it white or black? In other words, we need to qualify and contextualize intelligence because not all intelligence is the same across races, cultures, genders, and nations. Therefore, when talking about AI, we need to make sure the machines are learning the right things and not spreading bias, discrimination, and misinformation because "the fear, then, is not that AI chatbots will gain sentience and overtake their users, but that their programmed language can manipulate people into causing harms they may not have otherwise." (Paul, 2023). Especially now in the age of social media and the internet. We saw how misinformation led to racism and discrimination with COVID-19 and Chinese people, and "experts warn that those unresolved issues will only intensify as artificial intelligence models take off. Worst-case scenarios could include an eroding of our shared understanding of truth and valid information, leading to more uprisings based on falsehoods – as played out in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Experts warn further turmoil and even wars could be sparked by the rise in mis- and disinformation." (Paul, 2023). Justifying the need for the government to, therefore, prioritize safety in artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>This calls for design justice to be implemented when developing and programming AI because “such systems could be weaponized by bad actors to purposely spread misinformation at a large scale” (Paul, 2023), as we have discussed before. Some AI is built with machine learning, and it's important that these machines are taught to think ethically because "the danger is from something much more simple, which is that people may program AI to do harmful things, or we end up causing harm by integrating inherently inaccurate AI systems into more and more domains of society." (Paul, 2023). Hence the need for design justice. According to Sasha Costanza-Chock, "Design justice" is an approach to design that is led by marginalized communities and that aims explicitly to challenge, rather than reproduce, structural inequalities. It has emerged from a growing community of designers in various fields who work closely with social movements and community-based organizations around the world." (Costanza-Chock, 2020). It aspires to equal treatment of all people in technology and information, regardless of skin color, ability, gender, age, personal circumstances, or societal context. It presents itself as a solution to white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism through user interface and user experience design by deploying good user-centered design so that "We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems" (Neil, 2021). Design Justice is one of the ways inequality and discrimination are being addressed and resolved within the global internet community. </p>
                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>In conclusion, artificial Intelligence will without a doubt be of benefit to humanity in the near future; it will ensure that people live a better and more productive life. It will also revolutionize the way we see the world and each other. However, there are certain measures that need to be taken to ensure that AI does not create dysfunctional societies by misrepresenting, misinforming, and manipulating people into making wrong and unethical decisions. The advancement of AI needs to coincide with safety and respect for human rights; it needs to reflect all the knowledge and people that exist, not just those in power. AI needs to uphold and respect the integrity of democracy.</p>
