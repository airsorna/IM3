                    <p>Reflection on the readings.</p>
                    <p>The Library of Babel presents an interesting way of viewing the library as a place containing books/knowledge available to all mankind. This statement he makes here: "When it was announced that the library contained all books, the first reaction was unbounded joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact and secret treasure." (Borges, 1998:115). encompasses the idea of humans being intrigued by knowledge and their desire to have information; hence, librarians were entrusted with watching over the books. The same could be said about the internet; it contains all the knowledge and is easily available for anyone to use. The internet could therefore be described as a digital library.</p>
                    <p>As we may think, details about the invention and development of the web for storing, sharing, and accessing knowledge are described. Bush predicts the internet as a solution to the problem of knowledge accumulation and the rapid development of technology. As the internet becomes a storehouse or library of information in an ever-growing world where a simple search prompt allows us to retrieve information anytime and anywhere.</p>
                    <p>Your goals for this course.</p>
                    <p>My immediate goal for the year is to, first of all, achieve outstanding academic results in assignments and in the exam. This is important for me because I am repeating this course and would like to improve and rectify the mistakes I made last year. Part of learning is making mistakes, and thus I am excited to show some of the fresh ideas I have this year. The overall goal is to apply what I've learned here in the real-world for business opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Your experience setting up Git.</p>
                    <p>I already had GitHub installed; what’s left is to set up the files for the assignments and the exam.</p>

                    <h2>Week 2 - Blog Post</h2>
                    <p>How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video by Bruce Lawson examines how a visually impaired user accesses and engages with the internet. Smashing Magazine interviews the user as they navigate in and out of the websites using a screen reader; one important aspect noted in the reading is the use of semantic elements like main, nav, header, footer, etc. in helping Léonie Watson map out the structure of the webpage. One thing to avoid is having links that say Click here, as they are not descriptive and do not help those who are visually impaired navigate in and out of your website with ease. This definitely ties in with what I’ve learned so far about HTML; it’s important to use the correct semantic elements when coding to ensure its readability and accessibility for all.</p>
                    <p>Why You Should Choose HTML5 article Over section by Bruce Lawson explains the key difference between <article> and <section> and where and how to use them. The <article> is the most functional element that is used and reused in any context. For example, <article> can be wrapped for each blog post, video, image, comment, and paragraph. Most importantly, enclosing header elements with article ensures they appear in the reader. <section> is used to wrap headings so the browser can determine the HTML5 document outline. How this ties in with what I’ve learned about HTML is the importance of using the correct semantic markup when structuring and organizing code to ensure accessibility and readability.</p>
                    <p>Watching the tutorials and some Youtube videos while coding has made my experience quite easy. I understood the fundamentals and the importance of using correct semantic markup when coding. Since this isn't my first time coding with HTML, it was quite refreshing to revisit some of these fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>The internet was initially made for the military and universities as a program for doing research, but once commercial investors realized its potential, they began to develop the internet for the masses. Ever since then, we've seen the internet grow into an integral part of human interaction and civilization. It has become a library, supermarket, consultant, and recently an employer. Simply put, the internet is everything.</p>

                    <h2>Week 3 - Blog post</h2>
                    <p>-Your experience continuing the development of your website.</p>
                    <p>Picking up where we left off last week, we began working on our CSS coding for our website. This is where we start building the aesthetics and looks of our website. This is the glamourization part of the process, where things like color, font, layout, background, and image are stylized to give the website more life. The work I have done this week for the website was to implement a color scheme consisting of a white background paired with a toned-down green for the header and footer. The font I have chosen to use is Times New Roman for its slick and professional look.</p>
                    <p>-Reflection on the reading and lecture and how they tie into your understanding of UI and UX</p>
                    <p>Convention and Context by Steven Mailloux discusses how conventions are dependent on context. He makes a valid point when he says, "We can discuss conventions as ways of acting or as accomplishments of meaning, not only in literary and critical texts but also in discourses circulating in other cultural and social spheres." (Mailloux,1983:409). What I understand this to mean is that conventions are not a set of rules that must be followed at all times, but rather that conventions work hand in hand with context. In any given context, there are a set of conventions to be followed. How do I relate this to my understanding of UI and UX? Similar to conventions, UI and UX have a set of conventions one has to follow when designing a website, but again, not everything will apply as context is important. Maybe the website you plan to create doesn’t have an "about" page, for example. This is why context is important.</p>
                    <p>-Thoughts on the different perspectives on the course material presented by the supplementary material (past lectures)</p>
                    <p>I think the supplementary material helps to reiterate important concepts that I might have missed and offers a different way of explaining those concepts. It was insightful to hear the information twice and from different sources.</p>

                    <h2>Week 4 - Blog Post</h2>
                    <p>This week I finished the CSS for my website in preparation for the assignment 1 submission. I've chosen to use toned-down colors for the navigation bar and footer. I've used different shades of blue in a horizontal gradient to achieve the desired look I was aiming for. I made sure the blues don't overpower but complement each other and create a sort of optical illusion for the user. I know color is an important aspect for UI and UX; hence, I have chosen to stick with a consistent color theme to create familiarity. According to the information hierarchy, the important part will be in large font. This is where I am at the moment. Next step: adding blogs, choosing fonts, and adding images.</p>
                    <p>The wireframes hold up fairly well against the UI lecture, mainly because I have done websites before, but I must improve on some of the elements, such as scrolling down to specific blog posts</p>
                    <p>Reading reflection: The Basic Principles of User Interface Design details important guidelines needed to be followed when making websites user friendly. These are rules that guide designers to make their UI better. Such as striving for clarity, as the main purpose of UI is interactivity between the user and website, this could be achieved by aiming for simplicity and being consistent. The list of things one can do to improve their UI design is endless, as this reading only offers the basics of user interface design principles but is a great place to start.</p>

                    <p>My website</p>
                    <p>This week was all focused on finalizing my CSS in preparation for Monday’s submission. Color, font, and background have all been finalized today, and I have arranged everything in order as per the information hierarchy. In addition to the work, I have applied the basic UI principles with regards to simplicity and consistency in order to obtain clarity and familiarity. As of now, I can report that I am done with CSS and that all that is left is arranging everything together.</p>
                    <p>IxD Process</p>
                    <p>Goal Alignment: My goal is to create a personal website displaying all my work for the semester. It should contribute to my growth as a web developer and designer. It must showcase my creativity and understanding of what a website is and reflect my knowledge of coding with HTML and JavaScript. Moreover, it’s a website I want to show to some potential clients. So with that being said, I don’t have a specific target audience because, as I said, I want to show it to as many people as I want.</p>
                    <p>Information Structure: Content Mapping: Content will be sorted in its appropriate category, e.g., if it's a blog post, it's under the blogs section. From then on, using knowledge of information hierarchy, the important elements or notes will be given higher preference as they are what the user engages with most of the time.</p>

                    <p>User experience - a research agenda by Marc Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky offers a comprehensive framework for user interface design, providing three prominent perspectives for understanding user interfaces. These include Beyond the instrumental, which speaks to the holistic and aesthetic nature of UI; emotion and affect, which speak to the subjective, positive, and antecedent nature of UI; and the experimental, which is about the complex and dynamic nature of UI. The combination of these three elements forms what we know as the user interface.</p>
